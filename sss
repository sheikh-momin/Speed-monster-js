    <h1>When we get undefined in js?</h1>
    <h5>Undefined is also a primitive value in JavaScript. A variable or an object has an undefined value when no value is
    assigned before using it. So you can say that undefined means lack of value or unknown value.
    A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined . A method or statement also returns undefined if the
    variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was not
    returned .</h5>

    <h1>How event loop works in js?</h1>
    <h5>The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the
    Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such
    an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</h5>

    <h1>Difference between Global scope vs Block scope?</h1>
    <h5>Global scope — Global scope contains all of the things defined outside of all code blocks. A code block simply consists
    of grouped statements inside curly braces ({ }). if statement, loops, function are examples of structure that create a
    code block. A global variable has global scope. A global variable is accessible from anywhere in the code.
    Block Scope: This scope restricts the variable that is declared inside a specific block, from access by the outside of
    the block. The let & const keyword facilitates the variables to be block scoped. In order to access the variables of
    that specific block, we need to create an object for it.</h5>
